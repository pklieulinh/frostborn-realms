# Frostborn Realms – Game Design Document (Concise)

## Core Fantasy
Lead a frostbitten enclave after apocalyptic glaciation. Intervene sparingly; colony emergent behavior dictates micro outcomes. Survive escalating cold anomalies and monstrous incursions culminating in Leviathan.

## Player Role
Strategic Overseer:
- Approve doctrine shifts
- Enact edicts (limited concurrency)
- Choose event outcomes
- Plan macro placement (shelters, heat, trade posts) – (building placement logic appears in later branches)

## Primary Loops
1. Survival Loop (Heat / Fuel / Food)
2. Growth Loop (Crafting / Upgrades / Doctrine)
3. Threat Loop (Monster escalation → Leviathan phases)
4. Economy Loop (Trade & internal logistics)
5. Culture Loop (Morale, Rituals, Festivals)

## Resources
- Fuel, Food, Ore, Arcane, Medicine, Luxury, Trade Tokens, Knowledge
Derived: Heat Efficiency, Insulation, Morale Stability, Logistics Speed

## Systems Pillars
- Heat Frontier Diffusion (performance aware)
- Utility AI job role assignment
- Event & Doctrine synergy (Drift vector)
- Multi-phase Boss gating technological progression
- Trade Price Elasticity (light simulation, scalable)

## Progression
Years 1–2: Basic survival  
Years 3–4: Doctrine specialization, anchor tech hints  
Year 5+: Leviathan can appear (phase 1)  
Post-Defeat: Unlock advanced arcane & insulation tech branches (DLC future)

## Failure / Win
- Failure: Population collapse < threshold OR fatal morale spiral OR Leviathan annihilation event.
- Win (Beta placeholder): Defeat Leviathan and sustain 1 in-game year after.

## Modding Scope
JSON definable: Items, Events, Doctrines, Monsters, Recipes, Buildings, Palettes. Potential future script sandbox (C# limited reflection).

## Metrics / Telemetry (Optional Opt-In)
- Event choice distribution
- Doctrine adoption frequencies
- Survival duration
- CPU ms per system (profiling)
